# AoS-Dice-Roller
This is an application that can be used to simulate a round of combat in the tabletop war game, Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, a
game owned by Games Workshop LTD. 

This can be used for Age of Sigmar rules as of 3/20/2020. 

The check boxes will allow re-roll of 1 and re-roll failed rolls abilities. Per the game rules, re-rolls can only occur once,
so only one box for each phase of the combat attempt should ever be checked.

I.E., re-roll hits of 1 and re-roll failed hits should never both be checked at the same time. This will cause two
additional trials to occur, one that will re-roll the 1's and one that will re-roll the failures.

Failures defined as being less than the value you enter in the appropriate L column. 

***IMPORTANT***

The only cells that need manually edited are cells L:2 through L:5. Editing other cells may cause issues with the macro that
runs the simulation.
